# AW Gold Trend Trading EA

This is a custom Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade on the forex market using the AW Gold Trend indicator. This EA can be used to automate trading strategies based on the trend direction and oscillator values.

## Parameters

The EA has the following configurable parameters:

- `LotSize`: The lot size for each trade.
- `StopLoss`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit level in pips.
- `TrendPeriod`: The period used to calculate the trend based on the oscillator values.
- `OscillatorPeriod`: The period used to calculate the oscillator values.
- `TradeLong`: Enable trading in the long direction.
- `TradeShort`: Enable trading in the short direction.

## Custom Indicator Functions

The EA includes custom indicator functions to determine the trend based on the oscillator values. These functions calculate the average of the oscillator values over a specified period and compare it with the current oscillator value to determine the trend direction.

- `IsTrendUp`: Returns true if the current oscillator value is above the average, indicating an upward trend.
- `IsTrendDown`: Returns true if the current oscillator value is below the average, indicating a downward trend.

## Expert Advisor Functions

The EA includes the following functions:

- `OnInit`: This function is called during initialization and can be used to add any necessary initialization logic.
- `OnTick`: This function is called on each tick and is the main entry point for executing trading logic. It retrieves the oscillator values, checks the trend, and opens orders accordingly.
- `OnDeinit`: This function is called during deinitialization and can be used to add any necessary deinitialization logic.

## Custom Functions

The EA also includes custom functions that can be used to add manual orders, adjust the overlap recovery algorithm, and manage positions when moving in the opposite direction.

- `AddManualOrder`: Adds a manual order with the specified lot size, stop loss, take profit, and direction (buy or sell).
- `AdjustOverlapRecoveryAlgorithm`: Adjusts the overlap recovery algorithm based on the specified overlap value.
- `ManagePositionsOppositeDirection`: Manages positions when the market moves in the opposite direction.
